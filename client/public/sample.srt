1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,960
It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:08,880
must be in want of a wife.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,800
However little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:17,520
a neighbourhood, this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,280
he is considered the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters.

6
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:27,040
"'My dear Mr. Bennet,' said his lady to him one day, "'have you heard that Netherfield

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:29,440
Park is let at last?'

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,320
Mr. Bennet replied that he had not.

9
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,620
"'But it is,' returned she, "'for Mrs. Long has just been here, and she told

10
00:00:35,620 --> 00:00:37,320
me all about it.'

11
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,880
Mr. Bennet made no answer.

12
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,000
"'Do you not want to know who has taken it?' cried his wife impatiently.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,440
"'You want to tell me, and I have no objection to hearing it.'

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,840
This was invitation enough.

15
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,000
"'Why, my dear, you must know, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by a young

16
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,520
man of large fortune from the north of England, that he came down on Monday in a chaise and

17
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,000
four to see the place.'"
